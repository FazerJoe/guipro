# Graphical User Interface Productivity

GUIPro is a set of tools to improve usability, productivity and accessibility of the standard win32 interface while keeping the tools as light as possible.
GUIPro is mostly composed of "HulK" and "PortAL" tools.

## Portable Application Launcher - _PortAL_

The goal of PortAL is to give fast and easy way to launch applications.

* It can be thanks to icons in the systray or thanks to hotkeys.
* You can launch directly one application or you can open a menu to select what you want to do.

All the interface of PortAL has been made to be flexible, configurable and fast.

## HotKey UnLimited - _HulK_

When some tools exists to move the windows by pressing a key and clicking with the mouse ; HulK provide a set of features to help the management of the windows.

* The "Alt + F4" shortcut is not very good for the hand ; while using "Win + Esc" is easier and faster.
* There is not shortcut to minimize a window, so HulK propose to use the "Win + ~" one (and "Win + Â²" for Azerty keyboards).
* HulK also allow to resize windows using the right button of the mouse (when the left button allow to move).
* It also provide features to minimize the windows into the systray ; using a shortcut or by clicking with the right mouse button on the "min" window icon.
* If you do not like the systray to really hide a window, HulK can minimize a window in his systray menu ; so you can launch a program and completly hide it from you desktop.
